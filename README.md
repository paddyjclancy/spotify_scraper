# :notes: :hear_no_evil: Spotify Scraper Project :metal: :musical_note:

#### Intro

This project aims to utilise a web API of _Spotify_ in order to scrape data from the platform.

The primary goal is to fetch all information relevant to tracks within **ANY** custom playlist provided.

With a tool such as this, we can gain significant insight into the listening habits of users. Whilst this is a personal project build - planned for practice and enjoyment - the scope for scrapers in general is vast. Outputted data may thus be applied in an array of sectors; from targeted marketing and advertising, to academic and medical research into more serious matters such as mental health in specific demographics.

#### Tools practiced

- **Spotify for Developers** - Web API allowing for any developer to integrate Spotify content into their own web applications.

- **Spotipy** - Lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. With Spotipy you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.
