# :notes: Spotify Scraper Project :musical_note:

### Intro

This project aims to utilise a web API of _Spotify_ in order to scrape data from the platform.

The primary goal is to fetch all information relevant to tracks within **ANY** custom playlist provided.

With a tool such as this, we can gain significant insight into the listening habits of users. Whilst this is a personal project build - planned for practice and enjoyment - the scope for scrapers in general is vast. Outputted data may thus be applied in an array of sectors; from targeted marketing and advertising, to academic and medical research into more serious matters such as mental health in specific demographics.

###### NB: You can fetch data of up to 99 songs in a single connection session.     If you will try to fetch information of more than 99 songs in a single connection session, then you will encounter an error and you will not be able to fetch the data, as per Spotifyâ€™s policy.

### Tools / Dependencies
